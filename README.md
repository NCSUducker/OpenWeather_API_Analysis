"What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## Project and Findings
An analysis on weather was conducted by taking 500+ cities around the world with varying distances from the equator in order to better understand what the weather is like as we approach the equator 

## Project Part 1
In WeatherPy I created a script to visualize the weather across the globe in the generated cities. This created a heatmap based on weather characteristics. 

## Project Observation 
-as you move away from the equator in the northern hemisphere temperature decreases 

-as you move towards the equator in the southern hemisphere the temprature rises

-Latitude does not have a strong influence on humidity 

-Latitude does not have a strong influence on wind speed

## Project Part 2
In VacationPy I created a script to generate the nearest hotel in the generated cities from the Part 1 data set
-I filtered the weather to resemble my favorable weather conditions for destinations I would like to travel to, then generated markers for hotels across the map
-Images can be found in the VacationPy Folder, in the images folder.
